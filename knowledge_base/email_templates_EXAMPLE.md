## Key Patterns That Work

- **Personalization**: Use {{first_name}}, {{company_name}}, {{industry}}
- **Keep it short**: 150-200 words max
- **One clear CTA**: Don't confuse with multiple asks
- **Value-first**: Lead with benefit, not feature
- **Social proof**: Case studies, metrics, testimonials
- **Timing**: 2-3 day gaps between emails

## What to Avoid

- Generic "just checking in" messages
- Long paragraphs
- Multiple CTAs
- Overly salesy language
- Talking only about features
