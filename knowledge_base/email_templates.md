## Example Campaign 1: [Campaign Name]

**Target Industry**: [e.g., SaaS companies, Real estate, etc.]

**Performance Metrics**:
- Open rate: XX%
- Reply rate: XX%

### Email 1: Initial Outreach

**Subject**: {{firstName}}, quick question

**Body**:
```
{{firstName}} - this is one of those emails where i know the chances of you replying are practically nil

 I work specifically with partners at accounting and advisory firms in the UK. Basically, I build outreach systems that book qualified meetings with your ideal clients on autopilot.

I've been doing this for 6 years now and have worked with 60+ accounting firms specifically. Most see 3x to 10x growth in their LinkedIn presence and pipeline within the first few months.

Here's my offer: I'll book you 15 qualified meetings in the next 30 days or you don't pay a thing. I'd handle everything, you just show up to the calls.

Would this be of value to {{companyName}} at all? If so, happy to send over a quick video explaining how it works.

Thanks,
{{sendingAccountFirstName}}
```

### Email 2: Follow-up

**Subject**: [Subject line]

**Body**:
```
Hi {{first_name}},

[Follow-up email body]

Best,
[Your name]
```

### Email 3: Final CTA

**Subject**: Re: worth a look?

**Body**:
```
{{firstName}},

Last note from me on this.

I get that $100K in 90 days sounds like a big promise. But I've been doing this for 6 years and I wouldn't make the offer if I wasn't confident.

If growth is on your radar right now, just reply and I'll send a quick video breaking down how this works. If not, no hard feelings.

Appreciate you reading this far either way.

All the best,
{{sendingAccountFirstName}}

## Key Patterns That Work

- **Personalization**: Use {{first_name}}, {{company_name}}, {{industry}}
- **Keep it short**: 150-200 words max
- **One clear CTA**: Don't confuse with multiple asks
- **Value-first**: Lead with benefit, not feature
- **Social proof**: Case studies, metrics, testimonials
- **Timing**: 2-3 day gaps between emails

## What to Avoid

- Generic "just checking in" messages
- Long paragraphs
- Multiple CTAs
- Overly salesy language
- Talking only about features
